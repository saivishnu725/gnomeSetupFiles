# GnomeSetupFiles

This is a folder containing all my configurations in my 2year old Ubuntu 20.04 setup and which I am planning to continue using when I shift to Pop os 20.04 few months later.

## How to install/run

``` bash
It is just some random files/folder and don't have a particular installation process, would love to find some solution to migrate my current config across distros.. but until then,   :)
```

## Contributing

Contributing to anything not appreciated for the moment because this is my configuration and don't want anyone's help.

## Known needed features

I am planning to learn(my June-July 2021 plan) how json files work and to convert the separate files to a single long json file.
